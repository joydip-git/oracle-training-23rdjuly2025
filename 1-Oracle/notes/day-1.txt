PL/SQL: Procedural Language/Structured Query Language

SQL => 
	interact with data in a RDBMS
	it is not designed for complex programming
	declarative -> what data you want and SQL will figure out how to get that data

PL/SQL =>
	imperative -> allows you to define "how" to get data and how to manipulate it.

1. PL/SQL engine compiles your PL/SQl code into bytecode and executes the executable code. 
2. Once you submit a PL/SQL block to the Oracle Db Server, the PL/SQL engine then collaborates with the SQL engine and execute the code
3. PL/SQL engine runs the procedural elements while the SQl engine processes the SQl statements
