cusror: pointer or reference to a context memmory where a query result set is stored.

	a. implicit: select into, insert, update and delete statements automatically create cusror which is managed by the oracle itself
	b. explicit
	
	cursor <name> is <query>

ref cursor -> used in case of storing a cursor as returned by a function or created by a procedure
	type <type-name> is ref cursor [return return-type];

	a. strong	
	type <type-name> is ref cursor return return-type;
	var-name <type-name>;	

	b. weak
	type <type-name> is ref cursor;
	var-name <type-name>;

	or
	var_name SYS_REFCURSOR; (Oracle 9i towards)


1. open the cursor
	var-name.open(); 
	note: in case of for loop to read the result set using the cursor you dont need to open the cursor
2. use the cursor to read through the records
3. close the cursor
	var-name.close(); 
	note: in case of anonymous block, stored procedure and function you dont need to close the cursor as it gest closed by default. you need to close the cursor in case of a package-based cursor.

functions:
------------------
is a reusable code block that can perform a specific task and returns a single value
syntax:

create (or replace) function <name>(
	param1 [IN/OUT/INOUT] datatype,
	param2 [IN/OUT/INOUT] datatype,
	....
) return <return_type>
is
	--variable declaration
begin
	
end;
